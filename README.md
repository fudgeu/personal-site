# fudgeu.dev

The home of my personal portfolio - written using Typescript, held together using React.js and Next.js, and deployed via Vercel.

I built this website with the goal of it being both desktop and mobile friendly - a task that I haven't actually taken on before. I believe that this goal has been fufilled, and the results even exceeded my own expectations.

As of lately, I've also been working on making the website more accessible, implementing certain accesibility features and ensuring use of semantic HTML.

This site also showcases my first time (at least in many, many years) working with a 3D graphics library (WebGL), as demonstrated by the spheres floating in the background.

Here are all of the technologies and resources this portfolio uses:
- Typescript
- React.js
- Next.js
- WebGL
- CSS Modules
- Google Material Symbols
- Deployed on Vercel

## Local development

If, for whatever reason, you would like to experiment with the code and/or deploy this site locally:

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine & ensure Node.JS is installed
2. Run the following command in the repository's root to install the required packages:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run the development server:
   
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
